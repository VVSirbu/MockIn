# MockIn

**MockIn** is a high-performance, cross-protocol mock server for development, testing, and simulating APIs or raw socket services.

Features:
-  Supports HTTP and TCP protocols
-  Multiple ports
-  Flexible matching: path, query, headers, body, regex
-  Control API for managing mocks
-  Full request/response logging

---

##  Quick Start

###  Download and run:

```bash
java -jar mockin-cli-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

MockIn will automatically start:
- Port **9000** as the Control API
- And any ports declared in your mock definitions (HTTP/TCP)
